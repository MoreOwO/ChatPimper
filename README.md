So, you want to color your messages on a server supporting it. But uuh, it's annoying to remember to prefix all your messages with &d when you want pink. And I'm not talking about gradients.

## AND THAT'S WHERE THIS MOD IS COOL

Introducing **Chat Pimper**.
This mod lets you enable a prefix and a suffix to add to every message you send. You can also create gradients, disabled by default and then only enabling by starting your message with `#gradient`. Better color interpolation is expected to come in the future.

### Planned features
- [ ] Per server configuration
- [ ] Better color interpolation
- [ ] Local server (integrated) support

### Limitations
- Sadly, Minecraft limits messages length to 256 characters. So you may not send messages longer than that.
- Messages sent on local server are not broadcast because they wouldn't support gradients and coloring anyway. (I plan to add an option to enable regardless)
